![Voice Assistant Demo](https://github.com/yourusername/voiceassistant/raw/main/.files/demo-screenshot.png)

## üåü Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Real-time speech-to-text using OVHcloud ASR service
- **Natural Language Processing**: Leverages OVHcloud LLM endpoints (Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct)
- **Text-to-Speech**: High-quality voice synthesis with multiple languages and emotional tones
- **Subtitle Generation**: SRT file creation for accessibility or content creation
- **Web Interface**: Clean, responsive UI powered by Chainlit

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- An OVHcloud AI Endpoints account with access token
- Access to OVHcloud ASR and TTS services

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voiceassistant.git
cd voiceassistant
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file with your OVHcloud credentials
```bash
OVH_AI_ENDPOINTS_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
LLM_AI_ENDPOINT=your_llm_endpoint_here
```

### Running the Application

Start the Chainlit server:
```bash
chainlit run voice_assistant_app.py
```

Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

### Setting Up as a System Service

To run the voice assistant as a system service using systemd:

1. Create a systemd service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/voiceassistant.service
```

2. Add the following configuration:
```
[Unit]
Description=AI Voice Assistant
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/voiceassistant
ExecStart=/root/voiceassistant/venv/bin/python -m chainlit run /root/voiceassistant/voice_assistant_app.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=voiceassistant
Environment="PATH=/root/voiceassistant/venv/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Reload systemd to recognize the new service:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. Enable the service to start on boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable voiceassistant
```

5. Start the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl start voiceassistant
```

6. Check the service status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status voiceassistant
```

Your voice assistant will now be accessible at `http://your-server-ip:8080` and will automatically restart if it crashes or if the server reboots.

## üîß Configuration

### Voice Settings

The application supports multiple voice options:
- Various languages (English, Spanish, German, Italian, Mandarin)
